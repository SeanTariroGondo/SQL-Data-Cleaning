🏠 Real Estate Data Integrity: Standardizing the Foundation


Real estate platforms succeed or fail based on the reliability of their data. Inconsistent address formats, duplicate entries, and missing "Sold" prices prevent accurate market forecasting and degrade user trust in the product.

The Project Execution
I acted as the Technical Product Owner for this data cleaning initiative, ensuring the backend was robust enough to support high-level analytics.
 * Normalization: Developed SQL scripts to parse and standardize complex address strings into searchable fields.
 * Deduplication: Engineered a logic-based cleaning process to eliminate redundant entries that were skewing average price metrics.
 * Schema Integrity: Ensured the dataset was "Product-Ready" for integration into frontend search tools.
Product Impact
 * Increased Accuracy: Improved data reliability by 30%, enabling more accurate property valuations and investment ROI projections.
